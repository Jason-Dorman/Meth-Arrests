# Meth-Arrests
After recieving data on meth arrests in San Diego from several police departments I used python to analyze the data. It showed an increasing amount of meth arrests throughout the county. That led to a large investigative story in which we discovered San Diego is "ground zero" for the nation's meth problem according to the DEA.
